You can either download the zip file (press the green code button) and then place both the mod and the OpenVicElderScrolls.mod file into the Victoria 2/mod folder to run it. Or you can use Github Desktop or any other such programm to clone the repo instead into your mod folder, though you would have to temporarily move everything in the mod folder into another folder and also move or copy the OpenVicElderScrolls.mod file into the Victoria 2/mod folder.
